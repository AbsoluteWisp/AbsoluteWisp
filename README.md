# I'm Adam. Hi!
I'm a beginner Unity game developer who uses GitHub as a public space to post code for personal projects (both Unity and others)  
I know a "decent" bit of C# and a very little tiny bit of C++.  

Other platforms
---------------
You can find me in these places online:
Related to coding in any way:
- **itch.io** \- My rather empty itch.io page is located at [ghostling.itch.io](https://ghostling.itch.io)
- **GitHub** \- This GitHub, in case you want a handy link for something is [github.com/Ghostling225]("https://github.com/Ghostling225")

Not coding-related, just other forms of contact:
- **Discord** \- My Discord account is `Duch#1157`. It's the preferred way of contacting me, since it's the one I'm most likely to bump into and check randomly.
