# AbsoluteWisp

Hi! I'm AbsoluteWisp (sometimes going by Ghostling, Duch. or Duszeniek). I'm a hobbyist, I used to use C# within Unity, now I enjoy making console-based games with C# and I want to get into Godot.

## Find me

If you want to find me online for some reason, here you go:
- Discord: @absolute.wisp (formerly @duszeniek, even more formerly Duch#1157)
- Itch: [AbsoluteWisp](https://absolutewisp.itch.io)
- GitHub: [AbsoluteWisp](https://github.com/AbsoluteWisp) (what a plot twist)
