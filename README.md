# I'm Adam. Hi!
I'm mostly here to have a log and backup of my coding process.  
I work primarily with C# (in console apps and in Unity) and sometimes TS/TSX in React  
I like making games (both small, console-based projects and bigger, graphical ones in Unity) and enjoy some basic web development (mostly in React)

Projects
--------
I am currently working on a (closed-source, at least for now) 2D run-based metroidvania in Unity.  
I plan on taking part in the GMTK 2023 jam this July and if I do, I'll make the source for that public.

**All my commits up from and including `Jun 25, 2023 CEST` are signed with an SSH signing key**
