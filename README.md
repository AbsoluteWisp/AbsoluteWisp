# I'm Adam. Hi!
I'm mostly here to have a log and backup of my coding process.  
I work primarily with C# (in console apps and in Unity) and sometimes TS/TSX in React  
I like making games (both small, console-based projects and bigger, graphical ones in ~~Unity~~ Godot) and enjoy some basic web development (mostly in React)

Projects
--------
Currently working on some private projects and learning Godot in the meantime.
